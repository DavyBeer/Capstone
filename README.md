Overview/description of the project:
    This application will allows users tocreate a user account, create posts, and leave comments on those posts

Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered:
    At the top of the screen, the title of the website is a link that directs to the home page. Clicking on the log in button will load a log in page, the sign up button will display a modal window with a sign up form. Currently there is an account already made, Username: GenericUser & password: password. There are 5 categories to make posts and each post can be commented upon. The author for posts and comments can be selected. 

Technologies used:
  html, css, js, package.json, .txt, virtualenv, django, bootstrap, jquery, popper


Ideas for future improvement
  - mandate a user account before posts and comments can be left
  - mandate that only the current user can leave posts and comments under their name
  - Create subcategories for more specific posts
